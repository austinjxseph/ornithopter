# Railway Configuration
# This file configures how Railway builds and deploys the services

# Note: Railway will auto-detect services from Dockerfiles
# You can also configure via the Railway dashboard for more control

# For multi-service setup, configure in Railway dashboard:
# 1. Create a new project
# 2. Add service "kirby" with root directory "/kirby"
# 3. Add service "website" with root directory "/website"
# 4. Configure environment variables for each service
# 5. Set up internal networking between services

# Kirby service environment variables:
# - KIRBY_DEBUG=false
# - FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Website service environment variables:
# - VITE_KIRBY_API_URL=http://kirby.railway.internal/api
# - NODE_ENV=production
