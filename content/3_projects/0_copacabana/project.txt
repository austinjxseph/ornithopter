Project-title: Conceptualising an app for an outdoor cafe chain with live events in Dubai.

----

Description: <p>Here, I conceptualised a consumer app for outdoor cafeterias in Dubai, creating a fictional chain inspired by various real cafes I frequented in real life. I used this project to test the product design waters, during my Google UX Design Certificate. I revisited this project later, in early 2023 — with an aim to hone my visual design skills, and learn design patterns (Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines in this case), in an attempt to follow industry standards as close as possible.</p>
