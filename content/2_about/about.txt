My dad was a COBOL developer back in the 90’s, and his love for gadgets meant I always got around to playing with the newest toys.  He bought himself an iPhone 4 when it first came out, and the amount of layers they weaved into the software truly blew my mind. About the same time, I read a biography of Steve Jobs which heavily featured Jony Ive and how much design was at the centre of their ethos.\u2028\u2028This series of exposures influenced my long term desire to be involved in design and technology in some form; started off as an engineering degree, some creative burnout, a segue to design, and a full-circle moment when I connected the dots between my love for code and my passion for design.<br><br>Man and machine have always been symbiotic, and thoughtful design has the ability to elevate those harmonies in the most meaningful ways possible. I felt that as a teenager, and I’ve been in an attempt to emulate a  fraction of it with my work. This has meant playing with design, code, and motion — forgoing labels, being a generalist, and creating delightful experiences for many more people like me.<br><br>This love of aesthetic appeal has also influenced other interests I have outside my career &nbsp;— I love good architecture, movies, and interior design. I attempt to dabble a bit in urban photography, and try to culture myself with some cinema.</p>"},"id":"96c6f032-7561-4834-9060-8d4f7a920eb3","isHidden":false,"type":"b-header"},{"content":{"columns":"3","items":[{"heading":"Skills","content":"<p>Web Design\u2028<br>Product Design<br>Branding &amp; Identity\u2028<br>Motion Design\u2028<br>Prototyping<br>Information Architecture<br>Design Systems<br>Front-End Development<br>Content Management Systems\u2028<br>Search Engine Optimisation\u2028<br>Marketing &amp; Analytics Integrations<br>CRM Integrations<br>No-Code Development</p>"},{"heading":"Tools & Frameworks","content":"<p>Figma<br>Framer<br>Webflow<br>Adobe Creative Suite<br>Spline<br>HTML &amp; CSS\u2028<br>PHP<br>JavaScript<br>GSAP<br>Svelte<br>ThreeJS</p>"},{"heading":"Work Experience","content":"<p>Shoreditch Design <strong>— Nov 2023 to now</strong>\u2028<br>Stealth Startup <strong>— Jan - March 2022</strong></p>"}]},"id":"5610ccd0-751e-4fcb-af31-2f31d0ecaf18","isHidden":false,"type":"b-text"}]
